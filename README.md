# Tuio Client js

This is a [TUIO](http://tuio.org/) JavaScript client aimed at running in the browser using WebSockets for TUIO trackers that provide WebSocket access.

It is build upon the osc library [osc.js](https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js).

# Usage
See the examples in the `examples` folder.

# Development
The [TUIO 1.1 Simulator fork](https://github.com/jkruke/TUIO11_Simulator) by Jonas Krukenberg adds WebSocket support to Martin Kaltenbrunners java TUIO 1.1 Simulator. This allows to test your implementation without an actual TUIO tracker.
