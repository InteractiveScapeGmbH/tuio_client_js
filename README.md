# Tuio Client js

This is a [TUIO](http://tuio.org/) JavaScript client aimed at running in the browser using WebSockets for TUIO trackers that provide WebSocket access.

It is build upon the osc library [osc.js](https://github.com/colinbdclark/osc.js).

# Usage
See the examples in the `examples` folder.

# Development
Our [TUIO 1.1 Simulator fork](https://github.com/paul-peters/TUIO11_Simulator) contains an [executable jar](https://github.com/paul-peters/TUIO11_Simulator/tree/master/release/TUIO_Simulator_WS) to simulate a tuio websocket on `localhost`.

We are also working on a TUIO2.0 simulator. If you like to have a look at a preview contact us at github@interactive-scape.com
